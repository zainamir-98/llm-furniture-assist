Description to assemble article no. 456 (bed)

Main Components:
- Mattress: The main sleeping surface of the bed, available in various sizes (twin, full, queen, king, etc.) and types (foam, innerspring, hybrid, etc.).
- Bed Frame: The structure that supports the mattress and provides stability. It can include components such as headboard, footboard, side rails, and slats.
- Headboard: A vertical panel or board placed at the head of the bed, often decorative, to provide support, visual appeal, and act as a backrest.
- Footboard: Similar to the headboard, a vertical panel or board placed at the foot of the bed, offering visual appeal and structural support.
- Side Rails: Horizontal components that connect the headboard and footboard, providing stability and holding the mattress in place.
- Slats: Wooden or metal planks that span the width of the bed frame, providing support for the mattress. They can be placed directly on the frame or attached to a slat system.
- Bed Legs: Supportive legs or posts attached to the bed frame, providing elevation and stability to the bed.
- Center Support Bar: A horizontal bar or beam, often found in larger bed frames (queen, king), running vertically down the middle to reinforce the structure and prevent sagging.
- Box Spring or Foundation: A secondary support system that sits between the mattress and the bed frame, typically composed of a wooden or metal frame with a fabric cover and springs or a solid surface. It helps distribute weight and absorb shock.
- Bedding: Includes items like sheets, pillowcases, blankets, comforters, duvets, and pillows that provide comfort, warmth, and decoration to the bed.
- Bed Skirt or Valance: Optional decorative fabric that hangs from the mattress to the floor, covering the space beneath the bed frame.
- Bedding Accessories: Additional items such as mattress protectors, mattress toppers, decorative pillows, throw blankets, and bedspreads that enhance comfort and aesthetics.

Instructions:
Step 1: Attach the Side Rails to the Headboard and Footboard
- Take the left side rail and align it with the headboard and footboard.
- Insert two small screws into the pre-drilled pilot holes on the left side rail and tighten using a screwdriver.
- Repeat the same process for the right side rail.

Step 2: Install the Center Support Legs
- Locate the center support legs and position them in the center of the bed frame.
- Insert a medium bolt through the hole in each leg and secure it with a medium nut using a wrench.
- Tighten the nuts until the center support legs are firmly attached.

Step 3: Connect the Cross Support Beams
- Take the cross support beams and position them horizontally across the side rails.
- Align the pre-drilled holes on the cross support beams with the holes on the side rails.
- Insert a large screw through each hole and tighten them using a screwdriver.

Step 4: Secure the Slats to the Bed Frame
- Take the wooden slats and place them evenly across the cross support beams.
- Use small screws to attach each slat to the cross support beams. Insert the screws through the pre-drilled holes on the slats and tighten them.

Step 5: Attach the Center Support Beam
- Locate the center support beam and position it vertically between the center support legs.
- Insert a large bolt through the hole in the center support beam and secure it with a large nut using a wrench.
- Tighten the nut until the center support beam is securely attached.

Step 6: Install the Bed Frame Feet or Casters
- Attach the bed frame feet or casters to the bottom of each corner of the bed frame.
- Ensure they are aligned properly and securely fastened according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Step 7: Reinforce the Bed Frame
- Take the L-brackets and corner braces and position them at the corners of the bed frame for added stability.
- Use small screws to attach the L-brackets and corner braces to the side rails and headboard/footboard.

Step 8: Adjust the Bed Frame Height
- If your bed frame has adjustable feet, adjust them to your desired height to ensure the bed is level and stable.
- Use a wrench or the provided tool to adjust the feet as needed.

Step 9: Double-check and Tighten
- Once all the components are assembled, double-check all the screws, bolts, and nuts to ensure they are tightened properly.
- Give the bed a gentle shake to ensure stability. If any components feel loose, tighten them accordingly.
